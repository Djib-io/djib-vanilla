Djib-vanilla is a lightweight, secure, and carbon-neutral web app to store and share files on the Djib network, powered by Solana

## Get started
You need two things to get started:
- Install dependencies
- Set environmental variables

### Install dependencies
You can install dependencies by running this command:
```
yarn
```

### Set environmental variables
First, change the file name of `.env.example` to `.env`.
Then open it and set the specified values.

## Run
```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## Build
```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
